export const ABOUT_ABSTRACT = `Hi, I'm Dari치n L칩pez, A mathematician turned software developer 游땙.

Currently working on continuous learning and having no "zero days".
Most of my professional experience comes from software development and
technical lead in the most diverse sectors, focused on web
development.

Fancied of music, simplicity and beauty of applied maths, and
videogames. I find that high level languages/tools and the low level
counterpart complements each other, and the journey to mastering
something involves getting things done and "reinvent the wheel" in
equal parts.`;
