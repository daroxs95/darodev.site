        <h1>👻 Greetings to the fellow geeks</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my official mental dump.</p>
        <p>
          I am a really busy person, so this site can be a little too
          quiet from time to time.
        </p>

        <p>Here are a few topics I probably would be writing about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Web development, mostly react 😒. Yeah, i know, i know ...</li>
          <li>Videogames, of course.</li>
          <li>Graphics programming, I really hope.</li>
          <li>Software engineering.</li>
          <li>Automation for really lazy people like me</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And a lot more 😶‍🌫️.</p>
        <p>Who am I kidding, probably this will be only web deb stuff.</p>
