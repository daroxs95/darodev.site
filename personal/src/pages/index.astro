        <h1>👻 Greetings to the fellow geeks</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my official mental dump.</p>
        <p>
          I am a really busy person, so this site can be a little too
          quiet from time to time.
        </p>

        <p>Here are a few topics I probably would be writing about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>🕸️ Web development, mostly react 😒. Yeah, i know, i know ...</li>
          <li>🕹️ Videogames, of course.</li>
          <li>⚙️ Graphics programming, I really hope.</li>
          <li>🐢 Software engineering.</li>
          <li>🦥 Automation for really lazy people like me</li>
          <li>👽 Pet proyects(mostly related with previous point)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And a lot more 😶‍🌫️. I hope.</p>
