      <h1>👻 Greetings to the fellow geeks</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my official mental dump.</p>
      <p>
        I am a really boring and busy person, so this site can be a little to
        quiet from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>Just kidding, I am no boring ... I think.</p>

      <p>Here are a few topics I probably would be writing about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Web development, mostly react 😒. Yeah, i know, i know ...</li>
        <li>Videogames, of course.</li>
        <li>Graphics programming, I really hope.</li>
        <li>Software engineering.</li>
        <li>IA trends and automation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And a lot more 😶‍🌫️.</p>
      <p>Who am I kidding, probably this will be only web deb stuff.</p>
