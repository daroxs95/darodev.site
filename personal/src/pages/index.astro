      <h1>👻 Greetings to the fellow geeks</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my official mental dump.</p>
      <p>
        I am a really busy person, so this site can be a little too quiet from
        time to time.
      </p>

      <p>Here are a few topics I probably would be writing about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🕸️ Web development, mostly react 😒. Yeah, i know, i know ...</li>
        <li>🕹️ Videogames, of course.</li>
        <li>⚙️ Graphics programming, I really hope.</li>
        <li>🐢 Software engineering.</li>
        <li>🦥 Automation for really lazy people like me</li>
        <li>👽 Pet proyects(mostly related with previous point)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And a lot more 😶‍🌫️. I hope.</p>
