Greetings to the hardcore gamers, and the ones that do not have the time anymore üò≠, and also to the casuals, basically to everybody.

This here is a non curated list of the last cool references or random stuff in videogames that caught my eyes.

### Dead Space 3
- Early in game an abandoned ship called CSS(i think) Roanoke is presented, as a reference to the abandoned town in USA.

### Borderlands 
- Claptrap runs on some kind of windows, in the Pre-Secuel has the ability VaultHunter.exe ü§£.

### Outlast

- What means, `This is what the game is` note, the math there is plain wrong. There is being used some summation method like zeta function regularization or Ramanujan summation on the divergent series, but is not explained anywhere, so is misleading AF for non-mathematicians.

- The formulae for Morphogenic engine is a little weird, I can't recall if it can be found on some specific math problem or if just made up stuff, either way seems a little simple for such an incredible complex artifact. Although it is really cool.

### STALKER Shadow of Chernobyl

- Reference to Che Guevara as beacon for cuban people. I personally love this titles but...
