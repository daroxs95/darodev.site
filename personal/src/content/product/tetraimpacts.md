As the technical lead on the project it is really satisfactory to steer the ship in the right direction and achieve a clean, low overhead solution for our needs.

Core highlights:
- Technical leading
- MUI inspired custom react component library
- High standard of quality, close to metal app and internal tooling performance
- Automation and scripting as daily basis
- Custom email rendering pipeline
- Leverage of modern headless CMS and edge functions
- Green and environmental solutions by squeezing performance and minimizing network and server usage without sacrificing functionalities or responsiveness

Key takeaways:
- During the design from the ground up of big system, stop and reevaluate technologies can be a key recurring task, not all state of the art solutions fit all cases,
sometimes do it yourself is the easiest more scalable way
